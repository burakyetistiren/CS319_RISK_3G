As a term project for CS 319 course, we will implement RISK.
Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players.
The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of the world,
divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents.
Turn rotates among players who control armies of playing pieces with which they attemp
to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls.
Players may form and dissolve alliances during the course of the game.
The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the board and in doing so, eliminate the other players.

Our project is based on RISK Global Domination, however some certain features will be added/removed.
